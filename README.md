OpenNIC (a.k.a. "The OpenNIC Project") is an organization of dedicated volunteers 
who run an alternative DNS network. OpenNIC is owned and operated by the OpenNIC 
community. 

Membership is open to all who share an interest in keeping DNS free for all users. 

The goal of OpenNIC is to provide you with quick and reliable DNS services and access
to domains not administered by ICANN.

More information about The OpenNIC Project can be found at http://www.opennicproject.org

OpenNIC provides resolution to all ICANN domains as well as OpenNIC's own TLDs:

.geek, .free, .bbs, .parody, .oss, .indy, .fur, .ing, .micro, .dyn and .gopher

Join us as we create a new surfing experience. OpenNIC domain registrations are free of charge -- simply register your domain, agree to the terms of the specific TLD you're registering with, and point your domain to whatever online services you have to offer.
